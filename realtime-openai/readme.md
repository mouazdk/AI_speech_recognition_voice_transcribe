Please note that this is a paid feature. We’ll be using the Python PyAudio library to stream the sound from our microphone. We’ll be using the python websockets library to connect to AssemblyAI’s websocket endpoint.

## Dependencies

```console
$ pip install pyaudio requests websockets openai
```

## Run Code

```console
$ python main.py
```
