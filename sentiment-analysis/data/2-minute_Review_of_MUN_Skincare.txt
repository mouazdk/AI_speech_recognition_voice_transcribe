Okay, see this beauty? This is the new Aqui Purifying cleanser by Moon. It's brand new. It's an oilbased cleanser, but it's not just an oil. It has this creamy consistency. That's lovely. You put it on a dry face and then rinse it off every really like. You can also use this with a washcloth if you want to exfoliate your skin a little bit more. I really enjoy this. And I'm not usually an oil cleanser kind of Gal. And this is really lovely, gentle. It smells great. And it washes off completely. The cool thing about the Aqui cleanser is that now it's part of this one, two, three Daily Essentials Cleansing System by Moon. So it's super easy. And there's two other steps that I'm going to tell you about right now. The second step is the Anaeros Toner, which I have written about before. I love it. It balances the PH of the skin. It's really good for sensitive skin that maybe gets red like mine. And it's made of all these amazing ingredients. So if you're even just looking for a Toner on its own, this is my favorite Toner of all time. It has, let's see, Bulgarian rose water, hyaluronic acid, Willow bark extract, goji Berry extract. It's really awesome. And I kind of spray on my face all the time. Last component is the Aknari Eh serum, which I think I've written about 5000 times. It's one of my favorites. It's main component is prickly pear seed oil, which is very moisturizing and lightweight. And it's antiaging, which 42 got to be thinking about these things. Anyway, I promised Munimi, who is the creator of this line, that I would give these three products together a full month trial before I said a word about them. And I've just finished the month. So my thoughts are this. I really like it. My skin this past month has been very calm. There have not been any sort of redness or flare ups. It's had a really nice glow, so I'm impressed. I'm definitely going to add that cleanser in. And the Moon team is super awesome because they're offering 15% off any of their products is on their website with the code new essential. Now, if you're wanting to know anything else, I have a much more robust review on my blog today to check it out.
